@section intro Introduction 

This is a brief description of documentation automatically generated by doxygen. 
This documentation describes  classes and
functions that make up NICESAT, an improved interface to SAT solvers
based on the NICE dag data structure. 


The class nicesat::NiceSat provides the public interface to the
entire library.  It introduces functions for constructing NICE dags,
producing CNF, and interacting with the SAT solver using a convenient,
incremental interface.

@section started Some entry points 

The basic data structure, the NICE dag, consists of nodes labeled with
an operator.  There are three valid operators: conjunction,
if-then-else and equivalence (or if-and-only-if), enumerated in
nicesat::NodeOp, found in @ref Node.H.  The nicesat::Node class
defines the basic data structure representing a Node, and contains
several annotation slots as well as an array containing the arguments
and several bits used for book-keeping.  The other important data
structure is the nicesat::Edge, which represents an edge in the graph.
An edge can point to a node, a variable, or the constant true.  Each
edge is either positive or negative.  Basically, the nicesat::Edge is
a smart pointer to a nicesat::Node that uses the two low-order bits
to indicate the other "special" nodes.

In the future we will add a tutorial and a more detailed description of the interface provided by NICESAT.
